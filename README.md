## About 

PredictBr is a global permissionless competition where players compete by making predictions concerning the price of various assets at various future points in time. In order to place a prediciton, players must stake a given amount. When the competition concludes and a price has settled, the player with the most accurate prediction is entitled to the total pot generated from predictions.

## Step 2: chose a game

Game States:

- Prediction Period (anytime before a game starts)

- Running Period (game has started, predictions no longer accepted)

- Resolution Period (a price has settled, players claim winning predictions)

- Resolved (claims are no longer accepted, the player with the most accurately claimed prediciton is eligible to their winnings)

---

## Step 3: place a prediction

Rules & Considerations

- Players are free to predict as much as they chose up until the moment the game starts.

- Players can predict prices that have already been predicted, if multiple players have a winning prediction the pot will be distributed equally amongst them.

- Your predictions will appear under "My Positions" while the games total recorded positions will appear under "All Predictions".

---

## Step 4: claim a winning prediction

Rules & Considerations

- At the end of a games duration, a price will be settled and a resolution period will began.

- During the resolution period, players are eligible to claim their predictions as the most accurate.

- The current winning prediction will be displayed under "winnning prediction" so that players can judge if they have a more accurate prediction.

- When the resolution period ends, predictions can no longer be claimed as more accurate so be sure to claim your winners!

---

## Step Five: collect earnings

- When a game is resolved, any player that has made a prediction equivalent to the listed "winning prediction" is eligible to withdraw the balance of the game (distributed equally if there is a tie).
